## Issues or UX Concerns

- Lindt Excellence page shows irrelevant products (see bug report for [TC_LT_Filter_001](../../bug_reports/lindt_bug_report_for_TC_LT_Filter_001.md)) (see **Figure 1**)
- Takes a couple of seconds for the page to load when applying or removing filters
- Confusing filter values (i.e., "Bar" vs. "Bars") for "Chocolate Format" filter category for Lindt Excellence products (see **Figure 2**)
- Some images for "Pick & Mix" products are misleading (i.e., the image suggests that the consumer can choose the flavor for each Lindor truffle but can actually choose only two flavors) (see **Figure 3**)
- Too many categories in the dropdown list of the navigation bar and some are repetitive

---

## Improvement Suggestions

- Apply changes to the Lindt database so that Lindt Lindor products do not appear on the Lindt Excellence products page
- Improve loading performance for applying and removing filters
- Review the filter values "Bar" and "Bars" for "Chocolate Format" filter category for Lindt Excellence products
- Add a description to clarify the number of flavor choices for "Pick & Mix" products, or replace the images
- Review each category in the navigation bar dropdown list and remove repetitive ones
